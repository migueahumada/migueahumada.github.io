So, I have a few [audio](), [game]() and [dev]() projects. Wanna check them out?

Honestly, I don't have much to say. Treat others as you would like to be treated. Choose now before later. Wash your hands often. Be passionate about what you like without being crazy. Face things as they come. Just be chill.

Those are my _mottos_.  

Use one of them and make it yours. ;D

<!--- Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
