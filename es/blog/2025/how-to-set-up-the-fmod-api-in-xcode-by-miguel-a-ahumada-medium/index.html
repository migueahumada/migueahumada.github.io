Love him 💚First download the FMOD API from this website. You’ll probably need to log in. If you don’t have an account just make one. Don’t overthink it.Go to the FMOD Engine section and select the version you’ll need. And select the Mac OS platform.Make a new Xcode console command project.Open the .dmg and you’ll have to drag and drop the folder into your Xcode folder project.I created another folder called FMOD_API and within that folder I copied the folder that I previously downloaded. Now, this is important, please delete all the blank spaces from the folder name.If you don’t do it, you’ll have problems when referencing libraries in Xcode. Idk why this happens but be careful.Open Xcode and go to the left sidebar and click the appstore icon that has the name of your project.In the new window, click in you project again.Go to the Build Settings tab, select All and Combined.Type in the search bar “Search paths”, and in the section Header Search Paths, add the include folders’ directory path from the FMOD API. These are .h files.You can also do this instead of typing all the directory, by using the macro $(PROJECT_DIR).Type in the search bar “Library search”, and in the section of Library search paths, add the library folders’ directory path from the FMOD API. These are .dylib files.You can also do this:Go to Targets in the same window viewGo to Build Phases and then to Link Binaries With Libraries. Here you’ll add the dylibs by just dragging and dropping them from the finder to Xcode.Now, go to the General tab and you’ll have the libraries again in Frameworks and Libraries. Change the option called Embed to Embed &amp; Sign, for all of your libraries .Write something and it should work correctly. If an error appears just use the clean build command (SHIFT + CMD + K) and build again the project.Oh! And to add a sound, just do it like I did in the example, which means that I copied the audio file into the project folder.Nice! You’ve used the FMOD API with Xcode.I like Xcode but this was complicated af.Follow if you want more stuff like this, or comment something if you have problems.Credits to Cody Claborn, Alejandro De León Languré and Guy Somberg.Kind Regards,Miko 🎧Resources:—-Music, audio, videogames, tech and much more.HelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyRulesTermsText to speech</p> </body></html>
