It also works for VS 2019.I have a similar tutorial, but for Xcode. So, if youâ€™re looking for that, just click here.This project was also inspired by Guy Sombergâ€™s talk at the CPP Conference 2017.Go to this site to download the FMOD API. Sign in, and then click in the FMOD engine to find your chosen version. I used 2.02.12 for Windows, not Windows 10 UWP.Open Visual Studio and create a new project. Make sure you create a Console App C++ project.Click on the FMOD API installer and install it in your VS project directory. Rename the folder if you want. I changed mine to FMOD_API.Open the .slnfile (the solution). Build it once so that it works with the default configuration. Errors shouldnâ€™t appear at this moment. You can either build it in Release or in Debug mode. The build shortcut is CTRL + F5.Go to the right side bar (Solution Explorer) and right-click your application, then go to Properties at the end of the list.Change the configuration to All configurations and your chosen architecture, mine was x64.Go to Configuration Properties &gt; C/C++ &gt; General &gt; Additional Include Directories and in the text box, type the file paths of the include files from the Studio and Core FMOD API. I used the Macro $(SolutionDir) to have a relative path. By doing all of this, youâ€™re telling VS to include the .hpp and .h files.Then go to Configuration Properties &gt; Linker &gt; General &gt; Additional Library Directories. Here, youâ€˜ll need to do the same thing but for the libraries, .libfiles.Go to Configuration Properties &gt; Linker &gt; Input &gt; Additional Dependencies. Here, youâ€™re going to use different configurations for the Release and Debug builds, so bear with me.For the Debug configuration, type these dependencies, which are .lib files.For the Release configuration, type these dependencies, which are also .libfiles.Weâ€™re almost there.Change the configuration to All Configurations and go to Configuration Properties &gt; Build Events &gt; Post-Build Events &gt; Command line. Type this command to copy the dynamic libraries to the output directory.An alternative to this script would be to copy the .dll files to the debug and release output directories of your project.Remember to change $(SolutionDir)FMOD\api\core\lib\x64 to your own path for the studio and the core API.Now copy this code, from the GDC talk and make sure to change the file path in System-&gt;createSound to the file path of the sound you want to play.Nice! You used the FMOD API with Visual Studio.Follow if you want more stuff like this.Credits go to Cody Claborn and Guy Somberg.Kind Regards,Miko ðŸŽ§Resources:â€”-Music, audio, videogames, tech and much more.HelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyRulesTermsText to speech</p> </body></html>
